## In Class Exercises

- Troubleshooting: Find issues in broken code samples
- Push HTML resumes to git

## Subject Matter Ideas

- Troubleshooting: Debug tools (chrome developer tools). Exercise to identify issues in broken code.
  Rubber ducky debugging.
- Customer Relationship Management (CRM): Perhaps part of the database information.
- Domains and Hosting
- Backend languages (Python, PHP, C#, Ruby)
- Bootstrap, LESS, Sass

## Final Project

- Students will find a business in need of a website or a website rebuild (preferably a rebuild
as the content is more readily available). Over the course of the class they will gather the materials
and put together a plan to complete the rebuild. The idea is to use wordpress and select a theme and
customize it and deploy that during the 2 month period following the course.
    - Design Questionnaire
    - Logo
    - Content 
    - Sitemap
    - Domain and Hosting setup
    - WP Theme Selection
- Students will present this project information at the end of the class.
- I think its also possible that for a few students they may decide they want to pursue something other
than web dev so we can allow them to select a more relevant project for after the course.

## End of Class Presentation

- Decide on a particular area of IT and profile some employers. Contact them about internship opportunities.
- Collect resources about that particularl area of IT, we can compile these and share them for future students.
- Do a presentation on your desired area to pursue and also discuss the project you will be doing during the
2 month course follow up.

## People to Contact for Presentations

- Chris from new breed about having someone talk about CRMs 
- Andy Vota about a tour of VEIC or someone who might be willing to present
- Erin Carrol about whether she might be willing to present
- Lucy about being a TA
- Jolee Main about being a TA or instructor
- Rachel Cote about being a TA

## Trainers Needed

- Photoshop
- Wordpress

## Different Jobs to have people present on

- Database administrator
- CRM (New Breed)
- Analytics and data visualization (Smart Resource Labs, Draker)
- Statistical analysis
- Hardware (Logic, Laboratory B http://www.laboratoryb.org/)
- Networking
- Hacking (Pwny express)

## Questons

- Removed the full saturday on Photoshop in lieue of a single night class
- Ended up reducing javascript to make room for HTML/CSS, we can reverse this and just
draw back the scope of what we expect to teach in HTML OR try to spread the HTML/CSS over some
of the night sessions
- Concerns that the course will be disjointed due to subject matter of night classes not
relating back to material covered on saturdays, should figure out a way to ensure that students
are using and retaining that data. Its complicated by the fact that we may not have the same instructors for the night courses as the saturday sessions
- It doesnt feel like we have time to cover 
- Need to clearly define the structure of the 2 month follow up period, we discussed the student
being responsible for planning and sourcing content for a project to execute after the class as a wordpress

## Other Subjects to Cover

- More javascript
- Saturday session to review other languages? I'm inclined to focus just on more javascript unless we want to reduce the HTML/CSS workload. There also seem to be some line week nights wihch could be dedicated to various other languages but I would worry about confusing students who are new to programmimg with the different syntaxes they will come across
- Discussion of soft skills like project management and tech support
- Security (this is probably too deep an issue to cover much)
- Gaming
- Mobile Development
- Hardware
- Outbound Marketing
