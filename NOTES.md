## In Class Exercises

- Troubleshooting: Find issues in broken code samples

## Subject Matter Ideas

  Rubber ducky debugging.
- Customer Relationship Management (CRM): Perhaps part of the database information.
- Domains and Hosting
- Backend languages (Python, PHP, C#, Ruby)
- Bootstrap, LESS, Sass

## Final Project

- Students will find a business in need of a website or a website rebuild (preferably a rebuild
as the content is more readily available). Over the course of the class they will gather the materials
and put together a plan to complete the rebuild. The idea is to use wordpress and select a theme and
customize it and deploy that during the 2 month period following the course.
    - Design Questionnaire
    - Logo
    - Content 
    - Sitemap
    - Domain and Hosting setup
    - WP Theme Selection
- Students will present this project information at the end of the class.
- I think its also possible that for a few students they may decide they want to pursue something other
than web dev so we can allow them to select a more relevant project for after the course.

## End of Class Presentation

- Decide on a particular area of IT and profile some employers. Contact them about internship opportunities.
- Collect resources about that particularl area of IT, we can compile these and share them for future students.
- Do a presentation on your desired area to pursue and also discuss the project you will be doing during the
2 month course follow up.
